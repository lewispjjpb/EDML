# EDML
The purpose of this Module is to assist players in keeping track of all their Elite Dangerous BGS related activities.
1) About the Elite Dangerous Mission Log (EDML) module:
a) The purpose of this Module is to assist players in keeping track of all their BGS related activities.

b) It is especially for people who are working as part of a team/wing and have to maintain an accurate account of influence related actions in order to help with team tasking and planning.

c) This does not send data anywhere and doesn't even require you to be logged onto the game in order to run.  It takes whatever Frontier data was created today ("today" occurring at the time you clicked the button) and creates an organized .csv on your desktop.

d) This module is specifically BGS-centric.  I want to add functionality, but I don't want to try to cover "all things".  Also, for the time being I intend to not require any advanced API to use, so a local file output is the likely end goal regardless of what else gets included.

2) Potential issues, especially during the Beta test:
a) The .csv output goes to your desktop, as that was the most likely file path that would be consistent across most users.  If you have an unusual setup, the EDML plugin may not know where to create the file, so will just do nothing.

b) I haven't quite confirmed the difference between server and local times, so the plugin may get confused when a local player session crosses over server times.  Let me know if this is happening; it is fixable I'm sure.

c) Not all BGS activity may be tracked, especially during Beta.  At the time of writing, I know I haven't written in Combat Zones or Scenarios specifically, and am seeking assistance from players who participate in those activities and are willing to share their log files.


3) About the author:
a) I'm just a dude, working on this in my spare time because I enjoy this game and community so much.  I will try to incorporate positive feedback as best as I can, time and ability permitting.
